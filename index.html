	    <h1>What Were Pot Shops Before Pot Shops</h1>
	    <p class="byline">By <span class="author">Haotian Mai</span></p>
	    <p class="dateline"><time datetime="" pubdate>April, 16, 2018</time></p>
	    <p class="description">Since the passage of Proposition 64 in the 2016 Election, great attention has been placed on the growing market of marijuana in the state of California. The city of Los Angeles alone has issued over 100 temporary authorizations to marijuana businesses since the license sales began this year, according to previous reporting by the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-pot-sales-la-20180216-story.html?=">Times</a>.</p>
	    <br>
 		<p class="description">With many expecting more and more marijuana stores to spring up in the coming future, it might also be interesting to look back in time and find out what were the places before they become the new fancy pot shops.</p>

	<section class="CenterDiv">
		
		<h5 class="heading1">Pot Shops</h5>
		<p>Yes, different store names, but similar contents.</p>
		<p>Although the state didn't legalize recreational marijuana sales of cannabis until January, 2018, let's not forget California was the first state to legalize medical use of marijuana since the passage of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. Many medical marijuana dispensaries have been in business for years.</p>
		<p>Take MedMen West Hollywood as an example, several years before becoming a MedMen retail store, the very same location was occupied by different medical marijuana dispensaries.</p>

        <iframe id= "swiper1" frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=45824834-3ef2-11e8-b263-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe>

		<p>MedMen, a Culver City-based startup, is a rising star in the marijuana market nationally. It has 18 facilities located in three different states and a total of 700 employees, according to its <a href="https://medmen.com/what-we-do/">website</a>. In Los Angeles county alone, MedMen has five stores opening for business.</p>

		<p>And look at the MedMen in Orange County, which turned an unappealing workshop into an eyecatching building you can't miss in the neighborhood.</p>

		<h5 class="heading1">From NoHo Scooters to NoHo Smokers</h5>
		<p>Check out this place in North Hollywood, which was known as an iconic scooter shop. Once introduced by the <a href="http://www.lamag.com/guide/sports-recreation/noho-scooters/">Los Angeles Magazine</a> as the "Best Scooter Shop" in August, 2009, NoHo Scooters is now permanently closed and is turned into a marijuana store.</p>
		
        <iframe id= "swiper3" frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="580.0083822296731" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=c4d75f6e-3efe-11e8-b263-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe>

		<h5 class="heading1">From Home to Pot Shops?</h5>
		<p>Considering starting your own business from your garage?</p>
		<p>How about making it a go-to place in town for getting marijuana like this one in Vallejo, CA?</p>
        <iframe id= "swiper4" frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=825e3610-3f00-11e8-b263-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe>

		<h5 class="heading1">An Even Stranger Past</h5>
		<p>"I enrolled my Daughter Basia in the Aloha School when she was 2 years old.  She is now 4 and reading books," a Yelp review in 2012 reads. "The Aloha School is a hidden diamond in the heart of Los Angeles."</p>
		<p>The outdated comment was one of a few evidences from the forgotten past of a private kindergarten named Aloha School. The school is now permanently closed for business.</p>
		<p>In replacement of the Aloha School, the place is now a modern-style marijuana store called the Pottery.</p>
        <iframe id= "swiper5" frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=7b902792-3f02-11e8-b263-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe>
		<p>According to California Department of Education, Aloha School was opened in this location in 1980. It has been in the child care business for more than 20 years.</p>
		<p>The Pottery, integrated from several cannabis retails stores previously around Los Angeles areas, just had its grand re-open at this location in March, 2018.</p>
